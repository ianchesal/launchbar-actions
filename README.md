# My LaunchBar Actions

[LaunchBar 6 got a big update to Actions](http://www.obdev.com/products/launchbar/extensions.html). They're a little more involved to make now but you get more power and integration with LaunchBar than simple scripts afforded you pre-6.0.

This is a collection of some of my actions.

I like to keep `~/Dropbox/LaunchBar/Actions` as the home for my extensions, and then I symlink that to `~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions` on any machine I own. Keeps my actions in sync. And, of course, That folder is just a clone of this repository.

At this point in time my actions are not codesigned. You'll need to tell LaunchBar to allow unsigned actions to use these or sign them yourself with `codesign`.
